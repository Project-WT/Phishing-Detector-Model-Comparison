# Phishing-Detector-Model-Comparison
We started by using the Naïve Bayes model. During our literature survey the naïve Bayes model didn’t rank among the top performers. After our implementation, we confirm that premise.  We implemented GaussianNB and BernoulliNB. We moved on to compare other ML models on the same dataset.   MultiNB and Random forests gave the best performance. As, the multiNB had the least training time we enhanced that model by tuning the hyperparameters to improve its accuracy up to 97.5%. Further neural networks were used to enhance our comparative study on this data. Bidirectional LSTM gave the best performance at 99.97%.   Thus, to avoid phishing attacks via SPAM emails we propose the usage of Bidirectional LSTM. MultiNB with hyperparameters can be used for lighter computational complexity.
